      "description": "This project is made by a research lab (Laboratoire des Sciences des Risques) of Mines d'Alès school of engineering. I had the chance to work on the project during a 3 months internship while I was studying at the UIT. It is a simulation called CESAR which describes a city where you can test different crises such as a fire. You can control some agents that in the real world can get orders from elected people such as the mayor can give orders to policemen, firefighters and such. The purpose is to lower the losses during the simulation such as a real mayor would do.",

It’s really important to train those people because those crises don’t happen often thankfully, therefore the representatives are not used to handling them. We must train them because there are lives at stake and they must be prepared to save the maximum amount of both people and material issues.", "img":{} },

We also ran into documentation problems, some features were not fully documented yet so we had to figure out some stuff by ourselves.", "img":{} },

In my group we were 3 (Enzo Dardaillon, Germain Galtier and myself). Our subject was to ungoogle a smartphone, meaning to clear the phone out of all FAANG products (mostly all Google products) to try to achieve the best level of protection and open source possible. The main purpose was to make secured smartphones for employees of big companies.",

Firstly, we needed to do an analysis on a smartphone files to discover how an android phone is made.
