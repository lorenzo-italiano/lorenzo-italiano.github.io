Some files were very large because of the geographic data, which resulted in a long processing time. To remedy this, we divided the files for different granularities (region and county) and made versions with and without the geographic data so that the statistical analyses would not be slowed down by geographic data that were not useful for processing. We also had problems with the Google colab tool, which is not adapted to large processing and sometimes had long calculation times. Moreover, this tool proved to be very inconvenient to work simultaneously on a notebook despite its name.", "img":{} },

It was therefore very beneficial in the technologies and methods I was able to learn. First of all, I had the opportunity to use Qgis software in order to have first insights of our data in a geographical form. I also learned how to make interactive maps with Python Dash. Moreover, all the data processing and storage was quite unknown to me. So I learned how to set up a data lake and warehouse using AWS to store all the file formats we had and to make SQL queries directly on these files using AWS Athena. Then finally, I learned via the Pyspark and Pandas libraries to do ETL(Extract Transform Load) and ELT(Extract Load Transform) in order to process the data to be able to analyze it afterwards.", "img":{} }

It is a simulation called CESAR which describes a city where you can test different crises such as a fire. You can control some agents that in the real world can get orders from elected people such as the mayor can give orders to policemen, firefighters and such.
